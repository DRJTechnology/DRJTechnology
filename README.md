Hi, I'm Dave Brown, a software developer from Wales, United Kingdom. I have over 30 years of experience in coding Microsoft technologies. I have worked on a wide range of projects, from developing desktop applications using Visual Basic to building web applications using .NET and C#. I have also worked with JavaScript frameworks such as Angular and Vue.js, and have experience with cloud computing platforms like Microsoft Azure.

Since 2007, I have been working as an independent contractor, providing my expertise to various clients. During this time, I have worked on several projects across multiple businesses.

Recently, I have been working with Microsoft Blazor, a framework for building web applications using C# and .NET. I find it to be a powerful tool, allowing front-end development using the same C# syntax as the middle and back-end application layers.

I am passionate about coding and enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and trends. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and work with like-minded developers.
